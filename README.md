# Interactive Resume - Tableau

## Data
I uploaded data from my resume to Google Sheets using the following columns: experience, title, type, start date, end date, and description. 
- Experience: The location that the experience took place at such as a school or organization
- Title: The position I held at the time of the experience such as student or worker
- Type: The experience category (work, school, skill)
- Start Date: When the experience started
- End Date: When the experience ended
- Description: Description of the experience (optional)

## Design
I used Tableau Public to visualize the dataset that I created in Google Sheets. There are four different categories featured on my interactive resume.

#### Interests
I created three circle charts that display the interest and description when hovered on. The color depends on the experience.
#### Experience
My experiences are displayed on a  Gantt bar chart. Users can sort between projects, work, school, or all. It shows the duration that I participated in each of those activities.
#### Certifications
My certifications are created the same way as interest; there's just more of them!
#### Skills
I created a circular bar chart to display skills. Each skill show the name, date I started learning, and description when hovered on.
